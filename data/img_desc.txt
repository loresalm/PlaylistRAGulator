There's a contemporary design element with a series of pink linear lights above the seating area, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The floor is dark, which contrasts with the light ceiling, enhancing depth perception.

There are several potted plants placed around the space, adding a touch of nature and softening the hard lines of the architecture. The furniture includes chairs and tables arranged for social interaction or individual use, suggesting this is a communal area designed for relaxation or waiting.

The walls are made of concrete with a textured appearance, which gives a raw and industrial feel to the space. Large windows let in natural light during the day, and their size suggests they offer a view of the exterior.

There's a large white rectangular feature on the wall, adding a modern touch to the design. The overall vibe of the place is sleek, modern, and inviting, with a touch of sophistication due to the clean lines and minimal decorations.
